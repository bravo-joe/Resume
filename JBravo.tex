California State University, Sacramento - May 2021 % Finished the program in May, but awarded the degree in June?
\subsubsection*{Relevant Coursework}
\quad Classical Mechanics, Optics, Thermodynamics, Electronics and Instrumentation, Advanced Physics Laboratory, Biology I, General Chemistry I \& II, Mathematical Methods, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Programming Methods, Probability and Statistics, Statistical Programming, Big Data % Chose not to use bullet points to conserve space.

\subsubsection*{Laboratory Skills}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.15 em} % modifies spacing between bullet points. 
\item Chemistry: titration, spectroscopy, reflux, distillation, acid-base interactions.
\item Electronics: linear and non-linear circuits, sensors and transducers, operational amplifiers, basic digital circuitry, and introduction to computerized data acquisition.
\item Optics: geometrical optics, single and double slit interference and diffraction, Michelson interferometer, polarization, He-Ne lasers, photomultipliers, error analysis.
\end{itemize}

%NLP or natural language processing.
\subsubsection*{Technical Profile}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.15 em}
\item Programming proficiency with Python (Spyder), R (RStudio), and Julia (Juno). Capable with Java (BlueJ), C++, and SQL.
\item Software literacy include Wolfram Mathematica,\,\LaTeX, Bash (Unix shell), Git version control, HTML, XML, Markdown, MS Office Suite. Used best practices with respect to memory efficiency by monitoring performance and identifying bottlenecks in a given program or process.
\item Employed principles of OOP in building, iterating, validating, and troubleshooting (debugging) algorithms and models.
\item Experience with statistical modeling, principles, techniques, and applications complemented by knowledge of major statistical software, statistical programming, and data visualization.
\item Good knowledge of big data analytics via training in cloud computing. Used S3 from AWS to store data and Athena (AWS) to query data using standard SQL. Also used AMI and EC2 instances from AWS to manipulate large datasets for exploratory data analysis, distributional tests, dimensional reduction through PCA, clustering using k-means, natural language processing, and data plotting. Familiar with stream sampling and implementations of pipelines. Introduced to statistical learning models.
\item Quality technical writing and public speaking skills as well as a high level of interpersonal skills.
\item Languages: Spanish (Read/Speak)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Projects}
\centerline{Topological Flips - Senior Project \hfill Summer 2020 – May 2021}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.15 em}
\item Studied Lie Groups to describe skateboard stunts as algebraic structures. Our group produced a theorem to describe skateboard tricks from four fundamental stunts/elements in $SO(3)$.
\item Used SymPy to create a catalog of stunts using symbolic matrices. Then created Python software to allow users to view rotational matrix or render a GIF of a stunt.
\end{itemize}
